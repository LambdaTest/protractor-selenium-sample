* [Executing the Test](#executing-the-test)
* [Testing Locally Hosted or Privately Hosted Projects](#testing-locally-hosted-or-privately-hosted-projects)

## Pre-requisites 

Before getting started with Selenium automation testing on LambdaTest, you need to:

* Download and install **NodeJS**. You should be having **NodeJS v6** or newer. Click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download.
* Make sure you are using the latest version of **JavaScript**.
* Install **npm** from the official website by clicking [here](https://www.npmjs.com/).
* Download [Selenium JavaScript bindings](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/) from the official website. Latest versions of **Selenium Client** and **WebDriver** are ideal for running your JavaScript automation testing script on LambdaTest’s Selenium Grid.

### Installing Selenium Dependencies and tutorial repo

Clone the LambdaTest’s [protractor-selenium-sample repository](https://github.com/LambdaTest/protractor-selenium-sample) and navigate to the code directory as shown below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/protractor-selenium-sample
cd protractor-selenium-sample
```
Install the required project dependencies using the command below:

```bash
npm install
```

### Setting up Your Authentication

Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts on LambdaTest Selenium Grid. You can obtain these credentials from the [LambdaTest Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build) or through [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/login).

Set LambdaTest `Username` and `Access Key` in environment variables.
  * For **Linux/macOS**:
  ```bash
  export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
  ```
  * For **Windows**:
  ```bash
  set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
  ```

## Run Your First Test

### Sample Test with ProtractorJS

Let’s check a sample **Protractor** Selenium code running on LambdaTest Selenium Grid. This is a simple Protractor test automation script that tests a sample to-do list app. 
```js
 // single.js

describe('Add todo Lists', function () {
    browser.ignoreSynchronization = true;

    it('Add Customer Test', function () {


        browser.get('https://lambdatest.github.io/sample-todo-app/');

	browser.driver.findElement(by.name('li1')).then(function (foundElement) {
                foundElement.click();
            });

	browser.driver.findElement(by.name('li2')).then(function (foundElement) {
                foundElement.click();
            });

	browser.driver.findElement(by.id('sampletodotext')).then(function (foundElement) {
            foundElement.clear();
            foundElement.sendKeys("Yey, Let's add it to list");
            });

	browser.driver.findElement(by.id('addbutton')).then(function (foundElement) {
                foundElement.click();
            });


		var foo = element(by.xpath('//html/body/div/div/div/ul/li[6]/span'));
        	expect(foo.getText()).toEqual("Yey, Let's add it to list");

    });

});
```

### Configuration of Your Test Capabilities

In this code, we are passing browser, browser version, and operating system information, along with LambdaTest Selenium grid capabilities via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the above code are defined as:
```js
 capabilities = {
    build: 'protractor-LambdaTest-Single',
    browserName: 'chrome',
    version:'latest',
    platform: 'Windows 10',
  },
```
> You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt **[Capabilities Generator tool](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/)**.

## Executing the Test

The tests can be executed in the terminal using the following command:

```bash
npm run single
```
Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on [LambdaTest automation dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build). LambdaTest Automation Dashboard will help you view all your text logs, screenshots and video recording for your entire automation tests.

## Running Your Parallel Tests Using Protractor Framework

### Executing Parallel Tests with Protractor

To run parallel tests using **Protractor**, we would have to execute the below command in the terminal:

```bash
npm run parallel
```
Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on [LambdaTest automation dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build).

## Testing Locally Hosted or Privately Hosted Projects

You can test your locally hosted or privately hosted projects with [LambdaTest Selenium grid cloud](https://www.lambdatest.com/selenium-automation) using LambdaTest Tunnel app. All you would have to do is set up an SSH tunnel using LambdaTest Tunnel app and pass toggle `tunnel = True` via desired capabilities. LambdaTest Tunnel establishes a secure SSH protocol based tunnel that allows you in testing your locally hosted or privately hosted pages, even before they are made live.

>Refer our [LambdaTest Tunnel documentation](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/) for more information.

Here’s how you can establish LambdaTest Tunnel.

>Download the binary file of:
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Windows](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/windows/64bit/LT_Windows.zip)
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Mac](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/mac/64bit/LT_Mac.zip)
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Linux](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/linux/64bit/LT_Linux.zip)

Open command prompt and navigate to the binary folder.

Run the following command:
```bash
LT -user {user’s login email} -key {user’s access key}
```
So if your user name is lambdatest@example.com and key is 123456, the command would be:
```bash
LT -user lambdatest@example.com -key 123456
```
Once you are able to connect **LambdaTest Tunnel** successfully, you would just have to pass on tunnel capabilities in the code shown below :

**Tunnel Capability**
```js
const capabilities = {
        tunnel: true,
}
```
